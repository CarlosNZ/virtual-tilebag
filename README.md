An online tool for people who want to play a game of physical Scrabble, in real-time, with other humans but, for whatever reason (such as a global pandemic) are physically isolated from each other.  Basically, it’s a shared, virtual tile bag. You provide the rest.

Inspired by online Maths educator, **Matt Parker**’s valiant attempt to solve the problem of [how to play Scrabble over a video call]. His solution, while theoretically solid, seemed to be a bit impractical to actually do every time you want to play a game, not to mention error-prone (see video, lol). Hence the **virtual tilebag** was born.
